#Java Notes

##Singleton
* only one instance of an object exists at a time
* all references for an object of this class will point to the same object
* StrategyPattern8.hr

##Dynamic vs Static Binding
* Static binding means you know the type of object you're instantiating at compile time, this could be a simple statement like 
`ArrayList<Integer> temp = new ArrayList<>();`
* Dynamic binding means you don't know the dynamic type of an object until runtime. An example from class is the switch statement we had to determine the price type.
